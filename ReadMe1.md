# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This was an assignment to refactor existing code, or make it more efficient and sustainable. Here we were asked to organize as well as meet accesibility standards. To meet those standards I arranged my code from top to bottom, as it should be read. I also eliminated all but one necessary div to adhere to the proper semantic syntax, added descriptions to images to further accesssibility, and added a more descriptive title for this webpage. 

My requirements:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
